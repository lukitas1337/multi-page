            <h1>Where Every Sip Comes with a Wag!</h1>
            <p>
                At Bark & Brew Cafe, every cup of coffee tells a tail—literally! 
                Founded by two inseparable best friends, Berners the Labrador and Lee the Poodle, our cafe is more than just a place to grab 
                a brew; it’s where friendships are brewed, too! Berners and Lee dreamed of creating a space where doggies and their 
                hoomans could relax together, share some treats, and enjoy each other’s company. Their mission was simple: 
                to make the world a little warmer, one wag and one coffee at a time. Whether you're here for the delicious coffee, 
                the vibe, or just to soak up the paw-sitive energy, Bark & Brew Cafe is the perfect spot for you and 
                your hooman to unwind and have a barking good time!
